# cheetah-responsive

[Jira ticket.
](https://jira.nationalgeographic.com/browse/DP-501
)
## Repository Directory

* c/ - CSS 
* i/ - Images (for examples, gallery icons)
* j/ - JavaScript

## Build/Deploy Requirements

* SASS interpreter, such as the Mac app Koala
* Upload access to NGM Static server - this lives in /dev/supercheetah/

## Usage Instructions

Add this code to your Cheetah article's data XML:

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.ngeo.com/hoefler/1-0-1/hco_fonts.css">
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="/dev/supercheetah/c/cheetah-responsive.min.css">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=3.0, user-scalable=1">
	<script src="/dev/supercheetah/j/picturefill.min.js"></script>

Now you can code it as usual.

### Adding Extra Images

Use this code to add each picture to your article:

	<div class="photo width-text">

		<img class="lazyload" 
		srcset="img/image1_2048.jpg 2048w, img/image1_1024.jpg 1024w, img/image1_640.jpg 640w" 
		src="img/image1_640.jpg" 
		alt="Picture of TK TK TK">

		<div class="caption">Caption TK 
			<span class="credit">Photograph by TK</span>
		</div>
		
	</div>

You can change the dimensions of the image versions--just make sure it is updated throughout the code.


### Adding Pull Quotes


	<div class="width-wider quote">"It’s a project for a generation, it’s going to take till 2040 or 2050, and it’s hard."</div>


### Adding Contributors' Notes

	<p class="bio">"I'm so happy to be a contributor," said a contributor. "And that this story is built in literally the most beautiful webpage I've ever seen."</p>

### Size Options for Media Elements

* width-inset: a small inset.
* width-text: the width of the text well.
* width-wider: a little wider than the text well.
* width-full: a very large image.
* width-cinematic: edge-to-edge.


## Advanced Usage

### Inline Galleries

We can include galleries using Joel Fiser's SlideShow.js (used in ISP projects). 

* Include jQuery at the very top:

		<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>

* Also include these extra tags (will be trimmed/concatenated soon):

		<script src="/dev/supercheetah/j/TweenLite.min.js"></script>
		<script src="/dev/supercheetah/j/CSSPlugin.min.js"></script>
		<script src="/dev/supercheetah/j/EasePack.min.js"></script>
		<script src="/dev/supercheetah/j/hammer.min.js"></script>    
		<script>
		function buildGalleries() {
			var slideShow1 = new SlideShow("slideShow1Div", "/dev/supercheetah/i/examples/masks.json");
		}
		function defer() {
		    if (window.jQuery) {
        		window.jQuery.getScript("/dev/supercheetah/j/jquery.focuspoint.min.js");
				window.jQuery.getScript("/dev/supercheetah/j/jquery.dfp.min.js");
				window.jQuery.getScript("/dev/supercheetah/j/cheetah-responsive.min.js");
				window.jQuery.getScript("/dev/supercheetah/j/SlideShow.min.js",buildGalleries);
			    
			} else {
		        setTimeout(defer, 50);
			}
		}
		defer();
		</script>
		<script src="/dev/supercheetah/j/Draggable.min.js"></script>    
		<script src="/dev/supercheetah/j/blockadblock.min.js"></script>    
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="/dev/supercheetah/c/inlineSlideShow.min.css" type="text/css" media="screen" />


* Add this code to the desired location--change the ID in both places from "slideShow1Div" if you use more than one:

     
     	<div id="slideShow1Div" class="inlineSlideShow">
	
	    	<script>$(document).ready(
	 	   		function() {
	    	
	 		   		// Change this path to your JSON.
	    		
	    			var slideShow1 = new SlideShow("slideShow1Div", "/dev/supercheetah/i/examples/masks.json");
	    		
	   			} ) ;
	    	</script>
		</div>

	

### Embedded Autoplaying "Textural" Videos

* Include jQuery at the very top:

		<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>
		
* Also include this script:

		<script src="//assets.nationalgeographic.com/modules-video/build/video.min.js"></script>
		
* At the desired point in your story, add the code:

			<div class="width-cinematic video">
				<div id="inlinePlayer01" class="inline ngs-video"
				    data-instance="inlinePlayer01"
				    data-type="textural"
				    data-guid="1d27f0cf-8b5b-44eb-865f-3093e64643ca"
				    data-account="2423130747">
				</div>
			</div>
			
* Change the GUID to thePlatform's GUID for your video.


### Additional Ads

### Removing the Leaderboard

In the package config XML, replace the ad block with:

		<object type="ad">
			<height>90</height>
			<width>728</width>
			<label>0</label>
			<adfile>/ads/ngmLeader-remover.html</adfile>
		</object>
		
		
### Promo Tiles

	<a href="/link/">
		<div class="promo-tile box">
				<img src="/2015/11/promo-images/img/06-motorcycle-repair-2048.jpg"> <div>
				<h5>Promote the Channel</h5>
				<p>Here is the descriptive text for promoting the Explorer site for the Channel.</p>
		</div>
	</div></a>
		
### Promo Drawers


* Include jQuery at the very top:

		<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>
		
* Also include this script:

		<script src="/dev/supercheetah/j/supercheetah.min.js"></script>

* Add this code where you want the box to appear:

		<div class="promo-series box-yellow width-box float-right include" data-include="/2015/11/promo-series-climate-change.html" />



### Promo Stack

			<div class="promo-content">
				<h5>More From the Climate Change Special Issue</h5>

				<img src="/2015/09/chameleons/img/chameleons-graphic-160.jpg" />
				<a href="/">Gallery: Click here for really cool ish</a>

			</div>
			
			
			
### Cinematic Introductions

Make a photo container per usual, and add class `overlay-title-here`. 

			<div class="width-full photo overlay-title-here">
				<img src="/2015/11/germany/img/01-windmills-990.jpg" alt="Picture of an abandoned nuclear power plant" style="">
			</div> 
			
Anything with the class `.title` will be moved to a `.overlay` div inside it after page load.
